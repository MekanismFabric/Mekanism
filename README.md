# Mekanism for Fabric, Minecraft 1.20 #

This is a port of the popular tech mod [Mekanism]() for the Fabric mod loader. The project aims to achieve full feature and content parity with the original Forge version, and stay updated to the most popular and recent versions of minecraft. Any inconsistencies or bugs should be reported as an issue.

# What is Mekanism? #

Mekanism is an independent Minecraft add-on featuring high-tech machinery that can be used to create powerful tools, 
armor, and weapons. You can find more detail on the features on the [**Official Website**](http://aidancbrady.com/mekanism/).
With features ranging from jetpacks and balloons to factories and energy cubes, the mod does not have a single unifying goal.
Nevertheless, these features combine coherently to create a rich gameplay experience that players will enjoy.

Mekanism uses a tier-based system to organize the majority of its core features, like energy cubes and factories.
There are four tiers: basic, advanced, elite, and ultimate. Players can upgrade their components to the next tier
by placing each component in a crafting grid and surrounding it with the necessary resources for the upgrade or in
world by using tier installers.

After using Mekanism for a while, players can obtain a near-indestructible suit of Refined Obsidian Armor, receive five 
ingots for each ore mined, fly with hydrogen-powered jetpacks, and have cute robotic friends following them around while they mine. :)
